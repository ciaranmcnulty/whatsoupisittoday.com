<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p><a href="/">Whatsoupisittoday.com</a> was built and is maintained by <span class="slink-sh">Simon Harris</span>. Credit for many of the ideas involved must go to Vedat, <span class="slink-cm">Ciaran</span>, <span class="slink-kh">Kirstie</span> and <span class="slink-dg">Dan</span>. Blame for the appalling visual design must go to Simon.</p>

<p>It all started when a staff member at Pret's Frith Street branch handed me a small cardboard menu detailing their soup of the day for the next few months. I soon found myself to be the office go-to-guy for countless, daily "what soup is it today?" questions, typically from Vedat.</p>

<p>This quickly became tiresome, and so ten minutes of hacking, and a Â£10 domain name later, the site was born.</p>

<p>It has become a lot more popular than I could have predicted.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<dl>
	<dt>Why is the site sometimes wrong?</dt>
	<dd><p>Data concerning what soup it actually is today come from a variety of sources, but typically the listings are read from the outlets' websites. It isn't rare for the information on those sites to differ from reality, in which case there's very little we can do about it.</p>
	<p>Think of the additional element of surprise as a small, bonus nugget of lunch-related excitement.</p></dd>
	<dt>What happened to Leon?</dt>
	<dd><p>Leon don't do soup in the summer. Their menu will return as soon as it becomes available.</p></dd>
	<dt>How can I get in touch?</dt>
	<dd><p>You can send comments and questions to soup at pointbeing dot net.</p></dd>
